This project generates C++ code from a configuration text file that describes the set of inputs (i.\-e. ports/topics and their types), data conversions that may be applied to the inputs, and a detailed specification of the output (i.\-e. list of types, hierarchically defined). The yarp bottle generator parses a configuration file creates a C++ file. After compiling the C++ file and subsequent execution, the result acts as a bridge between Y\-A\-R\-P and R\-O\-S. The generated code reads data from several inputs (Y\-A\-R\-P ports or R\-O\-S topics), and constructs a Y\-A\-R\-P Bottle as output. Note that the yarp bottle generator has two modes of operation\-: (i) From R\-O\-S topics to a Y\-A\-R\-P port (R\-O\-S-\/\-Y\-A\-R\-P mode) and (ii) from Y\-A\-R\-P ports to a R\-O\-S topic (Y\-A\-R\-P-\/\-R\-O\-S mode). On one hand, reading from/sending to Y\-A\-R\-P ports is straightforward because our code generator is based on Y\-A\-R\-P bottles. On the other hand, reading from/sending to R\-O\-S topics needs an additional conversion, which is handled by the run-\/time Y\-A\-R\-P to R\-O\-S converter yarpidl\-\_\-rosmsg.
